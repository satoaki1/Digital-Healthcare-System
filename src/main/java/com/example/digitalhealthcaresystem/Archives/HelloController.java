    // of the application. Since this controller is set in default, it could not be deleted. Despite multiple attempts
    // to remove this class, modifying the module-info.java file did not eliminate the errors, and warnings were
    // consistently received from the console, urging for its presence. Therefore, it has been retained, although this
    // class does not possess any special functionality or significance.
